        "But Cheddar noticed his friends, the hungry ants, looked sad. \"What\u2019s wrong?\" he asked. They needed food too! ",
        "Cheddar had an idea. He shared his cheese with the ants, and they all danced around happily. ",
        "From that day on, Cheddar and the ants had cheese picnics every week. They laughed and played, knowing sharing made everyone happy. ",
        "And they lived happily ever after!"

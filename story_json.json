        "Max invited his friends: Bella the bunny and Sammy the squirrel. They all worked together to roll the cheese home. They sang funny songs and laughed as they pushed the cheese along.",
        "When they reached Max\u2019s cozy house, they shared the cheese with everyone in the village. Everyone cheered and danced! Max smiled, happy to have friends to share with. The end!"
